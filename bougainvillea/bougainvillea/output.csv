"The ability to breastfeed is important to many mothers-to-be as more and more women choose to feed their newborn infants natural breast milk over synthesized formula. While it’s best to wait until you’ve finished having children to undergo , simply having breast implants shouldn’t prevent you from growing your family and breastfeeding your kids.August was National Breastfeeding Month, and our plastic surgeon in Orlando wants to shed some light on some of the common misconceptions about  and a woman’s ability to breastfeed including:Most women with breast implants go on to breastfeed without difficulty. There are multiple options for breast augmentation such as the type of implant (saline or silicone),  and the incision site for the procedure. If the periareolar incision (around the nipple) is used, you could experience loss of nipple sensation and nerve damage, which may make it difficult to breastfeed. Implants positioned beneath the pectoral muscle using an incision through the armpit or under the fold of the breasts will have the least impact on breastfeeding abilities. However, breast augmentation may affect how much milk you’re able to produce.Breast implants are made of silicone or saline, and both are FDA-approved. Some women are concerned materials in their implants will leak into breast milk, but this is highly unlikely to occur, even in the event of an implant rupture. Additionally, there’s no evidence that implant presence will harm a breastfed baby. Saline implants are filled with salt-water, and healthcare professionals feel that if saline were to seep into breast milk, it would still be safe. Silicone is not easily absorbed and is unlikely to interfere with the health of a baby breastfeeding as well.Women with breast implants or who are considering breast augmentation may think that breast implants lead to misshapen or sagging breasts after pregnancy and breastfeeding, but this effect is actually caused by hormones and impacts the breast tissue and glands themselves. A  can correct this sagging effect once you’ve completed breastfeeding and your breast tissue has returned to normal.There are many reasons a woman may not be able to breastfeed, and breast implants are rarely the cause. However, the plastic surgeon you choose will have an enormous impact on your results and your breastfeeding options. Make sure you go with a board-certified plastic surgeon to ensure you reach your aesthetic goals safely without damaging your breast glands, nerves and milk ducts.If you’re interested in breast augmentation, please contact Dr. Hartog in Orlando today at to discuss your breast surgery options.

"You may have heard recent media reports regarding breast implants and a rare form of cancer. The FDA recently updated information regarding this disease (Breast Implant Associated-Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)). The American Society of Plastic Surgeons is working closely with the FDA in monitoring the disease.BIA-ALCL is not a breast cancer, but a rare and treatable T-cell lymphoma that usually develops as a fluid swelling around breast implants. The lifetime risk for this disease appears to be about 1 case for every 30,000 textured implants. This equates to a 0.003 percent risk.   Rather, the FDA recommends, as do I, that every woman conduct regular self-examination.

"Fortunately, in plastic surgery typically we see mostly healthy patients. The reason they come to us is to improve their appearance and make their bodies even healthier in some respects. We occassionally have patients ask if they should do a ""cleanse"" prior to their surgical procedure. The concern is that between surgery and medications there will be an increase of toxins in the system. So some patients think doing a ""cleanse"" may speed up recovery, reduce discomfort and so on.

"The traditional approach to facial aging was to simply tighten facial skin with procedures such as faclifts and browlifts. However over the last 10-15 years, it has become increasingly accepted that the main component of facial aging is the loss of facial volume, particularly in the emples and around the eyes, and also in the cheeks, jaws and around the mouth. In fact, it can be shown that as we age, all areas of the face lose volume.The single most important component of any breast implant operation, whether for cosmetic breast augmentation or breast reconstruction, is ensuring that there is good soft tissue coverage over the implant. Most of the complications relating to breast implants are directly related to the quality and thickness of the soft tissue over the implants.Complications include poor shape, assymetry, hardening or capsular contracture, pain, rippling and even tissue deformity and breakdown in some cases.I have just returned from Amsterdam, where I attended the International Federation for Adipose Therapeutics and Science (IFATS) Annual Meeting. Fat transfer and the use of fat derived stem cells continue to have more and more applications. There were a number of excellent papers on already well accepted uses of fat transfer such as facial rejuvenation, breast augmentation and breast reconstruction. The long term stability of fat transfer in these areas was confirmed in numerous studies that were presented. I have just returned from the 3rd Congress of the International Society for Plastic Regenerative Surgery in Miami. There, I got to present my own paper on the Lipoflap procedure, and to listen to a whole series of excellent presentations on this exciting emerging medical technology. There was more confirmation of the benefits of fat transfer for breast augmentation and breast reconstruction, but the really exciting news was the continuing flood of evidence promoting the use of fat related stem and regenrative cells.The uses of fat as the ideal natural filler continue to expand. Using very finely processed fat we can now inject fat through very fine needles. This allows fat to be injected much more superficially than before. It is also possible to distribute the fat in a very thin layer under the full surface of the facial and neck skin to rejuvenate the appearance of the skin, fill out fine lines and wrinkles, improve facial scars and facial skin discoloration. The technique can be combined with other facial skin rejuvenation procedures such as chemical peels and laser resurfacing.As you may know by now, we are very passionate about fat grafting at The Bougainvillea Clinique. The BRAVA® System is an essential piece of the fat grafting puzzle. It's just as important as the actual grafting portion. Brava helps ""till the soil"" as Dr. Hartog likes to say. It creates space in the breast tissues, which in turn allows for more fat to be grafted once. Additionally, a higher percentage of fat will live or ""take"" when BRAVA is used. To such a degree that we are now making it mandatory to use it for all breast augmentation and reconstruction patients. We are very excited that Dr. and Michelle Hartog's local interview has gone national. It has aired in Georgia, New York and Tennessee so far! Breast reconstruction became the Hartogs' passion after Michelle's breast cancer diagnosis in 2010.

"As cooler weather approaches (by Orlando standards anyway), we tend to see more facial patients as people aren’t in the sun as much. This time of year is great for having a variety of face procedures like: Facelift, Blepharoplasty, Brow Lift, Neck Lift etc…But that begs the question, “what is a facelift?” Now with all the slick t.v. commercials and print ads for certain types of lifts, it can become very confusing for prospective patients. Each person is so different that there isn’t necessarily a “one size” fits all approach. There have been many advances over the last several years that do allow for a more minimally invasive approach, which in turn means shorter scars. Dr. Hartog has created the VALULIFT (volume added limited undermining). This technique combines adding fat to the hollow areas of the face and uses a shorter scar method. This creates a more youthful appearance without looking too tight or unnatural.The article below from Medical News Today defines facelift and other techniques in plain speak and not medical jargon! This is a great way to educate yourself before jumping into any procedure. The most important to remember is to always go to a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. Additionally, a facelift doesn’t stop the aging process but it does turn the hands of time back to create a fresher revitalized appearance.","Really, What is a Facelift?

However, only medical grade products, overseen by a physicians office, have strong active ingredients to combat the aging process. In the same manner as prescribed medicine. Obagi is in essence medicine for your skin. With any medication, it needs to be managed and treated with proper dosage. This can only be done in a proper facility to ensure maximum results. Various other product lines won't give you this attention and care because they are meant to be ""cash and carry."" That is not to say that is wrong or there aren't some fabulous maintenance products out there. There are! However, if you are truly trying to rid yourself of hyperpigmentation, rosacea, acne, fine lines and dull skin, there is no question that you need an aggressive line that has enough powerful ingredients to address those issues.Obagi is made up of several different lines.:The NuDerm system that transforms your skin to look more youthful, prevents aging and evens skin tones on the cellular level.Obagi-C Rx System consists of hydroquinone and vitamin C serum, which is proven to stimulate collagen and protects skin from the environment.Clenziderm gets to the root of acne issues and clears the skin rapidly.

"With every New Year come new trends in fashion, health and beauty. I'm breaking down the total ""must-haves"" in cosmetic procedures that use the latest techniques, accessories and technologies. 2013 is definitely YOUR year to look and feel your best! There is no question that there is no greater nemesis to a woman’s bod than cellulite. You can work out, eat right and take care of yourself overall and still have lumpy bumpy skin. Well, fret no more, is here. Vasersmooth uses an accessory, and we women love accessories, that breaks up the connective tissues that create those pesky dimples. This procedure is minimally invasive, can be done under local anesthetic and has almost no downtime! Say good-bye to cheesy thighs and hello to skimpy bikinis.Scarring is the main obstacle for women seeking perkier breasts. Traditionally, large scars were needed to tailor the breasts into a better position…not anymore! An internal bra is created, through tiny incisions, using sutures that lift and support the breasts into a better position. Breast implants and fat may be combined at the same time as the scarless breast lift to enhance the breasts even further. The downtime, recovery and complications are reduced due to having fewer incisions. It’s a total win-win! Please note not everyone will be a candidate for this style of breast lift. Those with severe ptosis and very heavy breasts still may require a classic mastopexy. Check out Dr. Hartog’s mentor Dr. Khouri’s website to find out a little more. He is truly a pioneer in breast surgeries.The Liquid Facelift uses a combination of fillers, Botox and/or fat to create a more youthful appearance using mostly non-surgical methods. This helps restore facial volume, fill wrinkles and give an overall appearance of rejuvenation. There is no question this will not replace a traditional facelift but this is great for quick minor improvements and for those not ready or needing more involved facial surgeries.  The results may be temporary but the confidence boost you’ll get is long lasting!

Ultimately all these technologies rely on the skill of the surgeon, rather than the technology itself, to obtain the best result.

"Fortunately, in plastic surgery typically we see mostly healthy patients. The reason they come to us is to improve their appearance and make their bodies even healthier in some respects. We occassionally have patients ask if they should do a ""cleanse"" prior to their surgical procedure. The concern is that between surgery and medications there will be an increase of toxins in the system. So some patients think doing a ""cleanse"" may speed up recovery, reduce discomfort and so on. Each practice will have its own pre-operative suggestions for their patients in preparation for surgery.What is a cleanse?Cleansing is a way to detoxify the body. It can be done with a strict diet, a prepackaged regimen found in health food stores or liquids (Master Cleanse). They are very restrictive and can be difficult to follow through with due to side effects. However, there are people who are true believers and then there are those (mainly in the medical community) that feel cleansing is bogus and has no real benefit to ones health. Regardless, we still get asked the about cleansing and it's a huge industry. Will it help with surgery?Again, there are several schools of thought on this topic. According to various websites, cleansing aides in metabolizing anesthesia and post-operative drugs, thereby ridding the toxins. With any upcoming surgical procedure, being as healthy as possible is ideal. Eating a diet rich in protein, grains and veggies will no doubt encourage a postive recovery experience. Before you do anything drastic, like a cleanse, always clear it with your regular doctor and then your plastic surgeon. Even healthy things, like Vitamin E, don't mix well with surgery. Always strive for a balanced diet and lifestyle practices before and after cosmetic surgery and you're sure to have a great outcome.If you are looking for an experienced plastic surgeon in Central Florida, please  today to schedule a confidential consultation",To Cleanse or Not to Cleanse Before Surgery,"June 10, 2013",http://www.lookandfeelbetter.com
"I have just returned from Berlin where I attended the 2nd International Society for Plastic Regenerative Surgery (ISPRES) where I presented my experience using . The meeting was extremely well attended with presentations and discussions on the expanding field of fat transfer for all aspects of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. In addition to the now well accepted use of fat transfer for breast reconstruction and augmentation, there were numerous presentations on new applications of fat transfer and it's true regenerative effects. One of the most interesting applications is the treatment of scleroderma or systemic sclerosis, a disabling autoimmune disease that results in excess collagen deposition and thickening of the skin and loss of blood flow to the tissues. In the face this is manifest in severe tightening of the skin, inability to open the mouth, exposure of the teeth due to lip retraction etc. In the hands there is often severe ulceration of the skin and even loss of the fingers. There were a number of presentations in Berlin demonstrating the use of fat grafting to improve these conditions in the face and hands, with impressive results. These results obtained with fat grafting demonstrate again that fat is much more than just a filler, and has true regenerative and healing properties due to the presence of stem and regenerative cells distributed within the fat.If you have any questions about fat transfer breast reconstruction, please  today or call us to schedule your confidential consultation.",Scleroderma and Fat Grafting,"June 11, 2013",http://www.lookandfeelbetter.com

"The Bougainvillea Clinique is still the only cosmetic surgery facility in the Orlando area to offer the Vectra 3-D Computer Imaging system. As an advanced user we have just been authorised to install the latest version of the software before it is realised to other doctors, and we are more impressed than ever. The list of procedures that we can now provide consultation for with 3-D imaging  continue to expand. The latest additions of the software now provide advanced 3-D prediction for breast lift as well as facial fillers. The system also allows one to do multiple procedures and then compare multiple images with different procedures. For example we can show you the effect of a breast lift procedure, or a breast lift procedure with an implant, or an implant alone. For facial imaging we can show you the effect of a rhinoplasty or nose job, by itself, or in combination with a chin implant. It is now possible with the Vectra 3-D system to demonstrate the effect of almost any cosmetic surgery procedure or non-surgical cosmetic procedure.The list of procedures for which we can provide computer consultation allowing you to visualize the before and after appearance include:Of course the computer imaging is still a simulated prediction, but the degree of realism and precision has improved by leaps and bounds since I was one of the first doctors in the US to adopt this technology more than 15 years ago when it was little more than a simple digital imaging and photo manipulation system. With each new upgrade the possibilities continue to expand.

"Of all the techniques I have yet used, Hydrasolve Liposuction is the gentlest. Using warmed water, it is even gentler than the Body-Jet (Aqualipo) device, and fat is removed with almost zero blood loss. This translates to less bruising and an easier recovery in my experience, particularly for higher volume liposuction patients. In addition, the temperature of the water can be adjusted as the device is used to impart more heat to the collagen. All the liposuction devices that create additional skin contraction such as Vaser, work by imparting heat energy or ultrasonic energy to the collagen, thus causing it to shrink and tighten to some degree. Of course the amount of additional shrinking and tightening is limited (probably no more than 15%). Using excessive energy can cause problems like uneven skin and a very firm and scarred type feel to the underlying tssues. Though still under clinical investigation by carefully adjusting the heat energy of Hydrasolve during the procedure, it does appear we can get some skin tightening with Hydrasolve, similar to Vaser. I believe hydra solve is the ideal form of liposuction for higher vole liposuction procedures due to it's gentle nature, and the ability to temporarily treat the area under the skin with higher water temperatures to gain additional skin retraction. Hopefully future studies will show how the contraction compares to devices like Vaser. As with all devices, skill and experience is required to obtain an optimum result, balancing skin retraction without excessive deep tissue scarring. If the amount of loose skin is excessive, then one may require a technique such as an abdominoplasty.",Benefits of Hydrasolve Liposuction,"August 22, 2014",http://www.lookandfeelbetter.com

"Drainless abdominoplasty is accomplished by meticulous technique wih minimal blood loss, and the use of quilting sutures to close the space between the abdominal skin and the underlying muscle. This allows us to forego the use of suction drains in most cases.

"The single most important component of any breast implant operation, whether for cosmetic breast augmentation or breast reconstruction, is ensuring that there is good soft tissue coverage over the implant. Most of the complications relating to breast implants are directly related to the quality and thickness of the soft tissue over the implants.Complications include poor shape, assymetry, hardening or capsular contracture, pain, rippling and even tissue deformity and breakdown in some cases.Inadequate thickness and poor quality of soft tissue over implants is seen when cosmetics breast implants are placed in very slim individuals, and in reconstruction after breast cancer when women have the expander-implant type of reconstruction performed.A simple and straightforward way to improve the thickness and quality of the soft tissue over implants is to use fat transfer to thicken and improve the quality of the tissues over implants.This procedure, known as the Lipoflap procedure, involves using your own fat removed with gentle liposuction, which is then injected using micrografting techniques into the tissues over the implants. This essentially scarless procedure creates thicker, softer, more natural feeling tissue over the implants.Depending on the amount of thickness and improvement required, the procedure may be repeated at two to three month intervals, but all patients will begin to see improvement after even one procedure.Unfortunately many women, especially breast reconstruction patients, are not informed of this procedure, and they are often forced to live with poorly shaped breasts, that feel hard and unnatural, and may even be uncomfortable or painful.There are also many cosmetic breast augmentation patients who have had repeated complications, particularly capsular cotracture, with worsening deformities of the breasts with each complication. The lipoflap procedure is often the only procedure that can salvage some of these problems for these unfortunate individuals.If you or someone you know has problems with breast implants, ",Fixing breast implant complications with fat transfer,"February 8, 2015",http://www.lookandfeelbetter.com

"Over the last two years I have adopted two major modifications to the way I perform abdominoplasty, that have made a major difference in recovery for my patients.The first and most important change which has transformed the recovery experience for my patients is the use of the ultra long-acting local anaesthetic, Exparel®. Exparel® is a specially formulated slow release version of an old long acting local anaesthetic called Marcaine® or bupivacaine. Whereas Marcaine® could be expected to last 6-8 hours, Exparel® has been shown to have an effect for up to 96 hours or 4 days. I have found using Exparel® injected diffusely into the whole area of the incision and the muscle wall to significantly reduce or even completely eliminate the need for narcotic pain medications. This technique I have also found to be far more effective than some of the nerve blocks recommended by some surgeons. The second change has been the incorporation of a quilting suture technique when closing the abdominoplasy. These sutures keep the abdominal skin tightly bound to the abdominal muscle wall, and eliminates the need for drains, something that patients used to hate. Using these quilting sutures spreads the tension on the abdominal skin over a large area and takes most of the tension off of the actual incision area. This also results in much less pain, fewer wound healing problems, and better scars in the long term.By combining these two modifications to my technique, I have found that patients can be up and about almost immediately, with much less need for narcotic pain medications and a much more rapid uneventful recovery. It is not uncommon for my abdominoplasty patients to return at their one week visit reporting that they only took one or two of their stronger narcotic pain medications. This means more rapid recovery, with fewer side effects like nausea and constipation. Patients can also shower within 24 hours, and no longer have to worry about the nuisance and discomfort of a drain. • Although not completely pain-free, the improvement for my patients considering the type of procedure, is remarkeable.For more information on this procedure, our office today.",Drainless and Painless* Abdominoplasty,"February 2, 2015",http://www.lookandfeelbetter.com

"Are you bothered by a double chin or excessive fullness in the neck area? I have just returned from Chicago where I completed training in the Kybella procedure and was also chosen to act as a speaker for the company as it is introduced to other doctors. Kybella is the first FDA approved injectable product that can be used to melt fat and reduce a double chin. The procedure is a non-surgical option that can be used instead of submental liposuction to reduce the fullness in the area under the chin, an area that many men and women are subconscious about. The procedure simply involves small injections of the Kybella (natural deoxycholic acid) in the area of concern, and except for some modest swelling for a day or two, little or no downtime. The fat is immediately disolved by the Kybella and will then reabsorb over the next month or two. The procedure can be repeated as needed every 2-3 months until the desired result is achieved. Most people will desire 3-5 treatments. The procedure is particularly suited for men and women who are in otherwise good shape, but just find it difficult to get rid of their double chin. Countouring this area of the neck and chin can make a spectacular difference in the profile, creating a much better defined jawline.

"As plastic surgery procedures go, an abdominoplasty or tummy tuck is one of the bigger procedures that we perform. The two most common things that concern patients is the more extended recovery involved with a tummy tuck as well as the fact that traditionally tummy tucks require the placement of drains to remove any excess fluid that can accumulate in the area between the muscle surface and the skin. We have incorporated two innovative products into the abdominoplasty procedure that radically changes and improves the recovery process, minimises the risk of infection, and allows a much more rapid return to normal activity. The first is the use of Exparel®, a long acting local anaesthetic that is injected into the surface layer of the muscle or fascia and surrunding tissues, prior to closing the wound. This results in up to 3-4 days of pain relief, cutting significantly the need for stronger opioid type pain medications. Not only does this result in much less pain and discomfort, but also minimises the side of effects of opuoid pain medications such as nausea and constipation. The second product we have incorporated into the abdominoplast procedure is TissueGlu®. This is a well tolerated tissue adhesive that bonds the tissue layers together and eliminates the space between the muscle and the overlying skin, which in turn eliminates the need for drains and eliminates the risk of drain related infections. Drains are the number one thing that patients complain about after a tummy tuck. In addition, use of TissueGlu® takes much of the tension off the incision line, resulting in significantly better scars. for more infortion about our drainless and almost painless abdominoplasty procedure call or  us. ",Drainless and painless (almost) Abdominoplasty,"April 4, 2016",http://www.lookandfeelbetter.com

"In the last 5-10 years, there has been a lot of hype about Stem Cell Therapy to treat all sorts of medical conditions. Unfortunately true Stem Cell Therapy is not yet practical for many reasons. In my own personal opinion the word Stem Cell is used excessively by many doctors and clinics to try to sell miracle medical procedures to the uninformed and unsuspecting potential patient. As has always been my philosophy it is very important to explain exactly how treatments work, what they mean, and to try to cut through the hype and create reasonable expectations. True Stem Cells are very specialized cells, called pleuripotent cells that can change into different types of tissues like bone or muscle or skin or nerve tissue when stimulated to do so. These can either be embryonic ( from fetal tissue) or adult stem cells. Fetal stem cells are of course vey controversial for many people because of ethical issues, and though showing promise in the lab, there are few, if any, true fetal stem cell derived therapies in clinical use in the United States. Most of the 'Stem Cell Therapies' advertised refer to adult stem cells that are found in fat, bone marrow, and in fact everywhere in your body. The problem is that with the emphasis only on Stem Cells, most advertising and recommendations do not explain the true nature of these therapies as we currently understand them, and relies on the hype and sexy nature of the word 'Stem Cell'. In reality there are a whole number of cells in our bodies, which are not true Stem Cells, that are probably as important or more important than true Stem Cells in the treatment of many conditions. These cells are called Regenerative Cells, they are known by many names such as MSC's, Adipose Derived Stem and Regenerative Cells etc.These Regenerative Cells have many functions, and can be considered like little floating drug stores, that can go where needed to stimulate blood supply (neovascularization) fight inflammation (antiinflammatory) prevent other cells from dying (anti-apoptotic), help with wound remodeling, block damaging immune responses (immunomodulatory), and generally secrete substances that help the body fight of diseases and repair itself. (Paracrine signalling) One of the most striking things about these cells is that they have the ability through chemical signalling, to home to injured and diseased parts of our bodies. They are like little smart bombs that know where to go.So when most clinics and doctors overhype 'Stem Cells', the truth is that only a very small percentage of the cells used in current 'Stem Cell' treatments are actual true stem cells, only from 5-15%. The remaining 85-95% are actually these regenerative cells, and which are probably of much greater importance.In order for our bodies to heal and repair itself, throughout life, we must have both these Regenerative Cells, as well as some Stem Cells in order to survive. This is whether we heal a cut, fight off an infection, recover from surgery, continue to grow hair or skin, etc. Unfortunately as we age these cells lose some of their capacity, or as certain parts of our bodies become diseased - say our bones or joints in arthritis - these parts of our bodies become overwhelmed, and do not have enough of these stem and regenerative cells easily available nearby to repair the damaged tissue. For the most part our Stem and Regenerative Cells are also bound to the little blood vessels in our tissues and can only work in the general area in which they are found.Fortunately, there are areas of our body where these Stem and Regenerative Cells are found in very high numbers, these include our fat stores and our bone marrow. The trick, from a therapeutic perspective is to transfer some of these cells from where they are not immediately needed and where they are stuck (attached to the small blood vessels), and allow them to be used in areas of our body where they are needed. Depending on the situation, these cells can be transferred quite simply by transferring some fat from one part of the body to the other, and thus place a higher number of stem and regenerative cells in or close to the area in which they are needed. Examples of this include treatment of scars and radiation injury, burn treatment, and even treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip, shoulder and other joints. In other situations such as chronic heart failure, it is of course dangerous to simply inject fat into the heart or the bloodstream, and the Stem and Regenerative Cells within the fat have to be separated from the fat, so they can be safely injected in a liquid suspension. In the United States, the FDA has placed restrictions on the use of highly purified Stem and Regenerative Cells from fat, as the claim is that by performing this separation process, doctors are creating a drug which must be regulated by the FDA. This is even though these are your own unchanged cells, simply freed up to do what they do naturally. The most interesting aspect about these cells when they are freed up, is that they are either signalled to perform their natural repair functions and go to it, or they are not. In which case they simply disappear back into the tissues and become dormant again. Except in the case of active cancers, where these cells can of course stimulate cancer growth by stimulating blood vessel growth, there are no know other adverse effects. Despite the restrictions in the US, thousands and thousands of such purified cell therapy treatments have been provided around the world, with no known adverse effects. In fact it can be argued that compared to traditional drug and surgical treatments, these cell therapy treatments are exceptionally safe. Of course there is the question of how effective these treatments are, and this is to some extent variable, depending on the disease, nevertheless when one considers the safety of the treatment the risk to benefit ratio is far superior to almost any drug or surgical therapy available for any disease. Where I believe the hype and dishonesty arise, is where unrealistic expectations are created in advertising by many 'stem cell clinics' in the US and around the world, and a failure to educate potential patients on how these treatments work, and of course that there is great variability of response depending on the disease, and the individual patient. There is of course also excessive use of aggressive and unethical sales techniques that take advantage of vulnerable patients, particularly by overemphasizing the word 'Stem Cells' and failure to truly educate how our cells work. Essentially the goal of current regenerative medical and surgical techniques, is to use your own tissues and cells as far as possible to allow the body to heal itself to the greatest possible degree, with the lowest possible risk of adverse effects. For the most part the methods available to us include various natural and unmanipulated tissues such as your own fat, bone marrow or blood (PRP or Platelet Rich Plasma) to achieve these goals, and there are many, many safe and efficacious applications that are easily accessible to patients in the US. Certainly this is a rapidly advancing field despite the restrictions imposed on physicians by the FDA in the US, and we are hopeful that over time we will continue to see the expanded use of these , with the addition of complementary medications, or surgical techniques as they develop and become approved.

"Breast reduction is a procedure where extra skin, fat, and tissue are removed from the breasts. While the most common reason for having Dr. Hartog's  is to reduce the discomfort caused by disproportionately large breasts, patients also see benefits including a more youthful appearance, better fitting clothing, increased ability for activities, and enhanced confidence.Back pain is a reason for many breast reductions.

Breast reduction is often combined with  to balance uneven breasts, resulting in a more balanced silhouette.Stretched areolas and large nipples may be corrected during a breast reduction to further enhance your appearance.Breasts that are disproportionately larger than your body make finding good-fitting clothing difficult.

"Every year our surgical facility undergoes an inspection by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) to ensure that we comply with literally thousands of regulations pertaining to the facility itself and patient safety. The Ambulatory Surgery Center of Winter Park, adjacent to the Bougainvillea Clinique, is unique for plastic surgery facilities in the Orlando area. Unlike most plastic surgery operating facilities owned by plastic surgeons, the Ambulatory Surgery Center of Winter Park is a state and federally certified facility, similar to those in hospitals and other free-standing ambulatory surgery centers. Other plastic surgery facilities in the Orlando area, though certified, are certified as office-surgery facilities, a much less rigourous standard. The AHCA inspection is almost always unannounced. Last week, on one of our busy surgery days, the inspector from AHCA paid us a surprise visit. Despite being busy with patient care, our staff responded magnificently, providing the inspector with all the information he required to conduct the inspection.

"Some of our Florida patients considering breast augmentation are concerned that the procedure will leave a scar. Although Dr. Hartog takes great care to conceal and reduce the appearance of scars during breast augmentation surgery, you do have an alternative – .Using your body’s own fat, breast augmentation with fat transfer is achieved by harvesting fat through liposuction and then injecting it into your breasts for a larger, fuller appearance.The added benefit of choosing fat grafting for breast augmentation is that you not only get the enlarged breasts you want, you also get to reduce stubborn fat around your belly or thighs. This provides an overall body enhancement with one procedure.Recovery time is also reduced significantly from traditional breast augmentation with breast implants.In order to undergo the procedure, you will need an adequate amount of fat to harvest through liposuction, and there are limitations to the increase in breast size available through fat grafting.To learn more about your breast augmentation options and whether scarless breast augmentation through fat grafting is right for you, call the Bougainvillea Clinique today at to schedule your consultation with Dr. Jeffrey Hartog.

"The traditional approach to facial aging was to simply tighten facial skin with procedures such as faclifts and browlifts. However over the last 10-15 years, it has become increasingly accepted that the main component of facial aging is the loss of facial volume, particularly in the emples and around the eyes, and also in the cheeks, jaws and around the mouth. In fact, it can be shown that as we age, all areas of the face lose volume. At the Bougainvillea Clinique we have been educating our patients about this, and rejuvenating their facial appearance by restoring this volume of youth, for 20 years. Dr. Hartog is an early pioneer in the use of fat grafting to restore facial volume, and his background in Oral and Maxillofacial surgery, as well as plastic surgery, makes him ideally suited to evaluate and treate facial aging. At the Bougainvillea Clinique we offer numerous approaches to treat facial aging including fat transfer, and injectibles such as Allofil, Voluma, Juvederm, Sculptra and Radiesse.
