" 147Call it what you will – ear gauging, tunneling, stretching, or an indiscretion of youth – but it is a dying trend. “Lots of my friends and rock bands had these big holes in their ears. I thought, ‘That’s interesting, something rebellious to do, I guess,’” one 19-year-old told the recently. Yet, he was finding as he prepares himself for a career that “a lot of places are not looking to hire someone with big holes in their ears.”Holes that are less than half an inch in diameter can shrink back on their own, but some people have ear lobe holes three times as big. The most extreme case is Hawaiian Kala Kaiwi, whose ears are almost 4 inches in diameter – large enough to fit a fist through! According to ear lobe repair surgery is not only the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the UK, but a growing trend in America, too. Who seeks earlobe repair surgery?For most patients Dr. David Halpern sees, it’s about finding work in a sluggish economy. There are punk rockers who went back to school to become teachers. There are avid golfers who wish to join the Professional Golfers’ Association and compete. The U.S. Army has a policy that earlobes greater than 1.66 millimeters in diameter won’t be tolerated. Some people feel the original stretching wasn’t done properly and led to an undesirable result. Other patients are teenagers who have finally grown tired of the hassle from their parents. Regardless of your reason, Dr. David Halpern is a triple-board-certified cosmetic surgeon in Tampa Bay, FL who specializes in reconstructive surgeries.  What is earlobe surgery like?Dr. David Halpern has found that no two cases are exactly alike and there is no standardized method to fix the unique shape of a person’s ear, so it all boils down to the skill of the surgeon and an individual consultation to determine the best technique. At the initial consultation, medical history and aesthetic goals will be discussed.

" 214Tampa Bay Plastic Surgery is helping area residents put their best face forward for the holidays with a new set of promotions running from now through December 2015. Sometimes called a “Liquid Facelift,” Dr. David Halpern injects advanced dermal fillers like  to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and folds, gently lift drooping facial features, restore natural contours and provide patients with a more rested, friendlier appearance. Botox, Dysport and Xeomin injections can be used in conjunction with dermal fillers to provide added lift, extend the lifespan of the fillers and (to some degree) prevent the formation of new wrinkles caused by involuntary facial spasms. If you know and where to look, you can find great deals on facial fillers and injectables, without sacrificing safety or quality.Sculptra is an FDA-approved dermal filler made from poly-L-lactic acid – the same type of material used in dissolvable stitches. It works to replace lost collagen in locations like the: nasolabial folds / “smile lines” between the nose and mouth; “marionette lines” framing your mouth; and chin wrinkles. The number of sessions and vials depends upon the patient’s condition and is determined with a patient consultation. The average patient may need anywhere from one to three Sculptra injections done, usually spaced 4-6 weeks apart. A general rule of thumb is to expect about one vial for every decade of life. So, if you’re 40, that’s four vials (with two vials injected, done in two sessions). If you’re 50, that’s five vials (two vials the first session, two vials the second session and 1 vial the third session). The good news is that the results can last as long as two years. Both Restylane and Perlane are FDA-approved dermal fillers comprised of non-allergenic hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring substance that enhances skin plumpness.Restylane and Perlane add volume and fullness to the skin to correct moderate to severe wrinkles and folds. Areas of the face commonly treated include: hollowed cheeks, deep nasolabial folds, lips, marionette lines and jowls. Typically, Restylane treats more superficial lines and wrinkles, while Perlane is used for larger areas and deeper creases.Conveniently, your full treatment will be injected all on the same day. Most patients can get by with one syringe of Restylane, but up to four injections of Perlane may be needed to restore volume in the cheek area. Restylane and Perlane injections last from six to 12 months. Dysport, Botox and Xeomin are FDA-approved injections synthesized from Botulinum Toxin A.Unlike fillers, which restore volume, these injections work to temporarily paralyze the muscles responsible for involuntary facial spasms that create unwanted wrinkles. Treatment areas include: fine “crow’s feet eye” wrinkles, deep forehead creases and “frown line” furrows between the eyebrows (also sometimes referred to as “glabellar lines”). Your , Dysport or Xeomin treatment can be done during one visit, for one price. The treatment generally lasts from three to six months, but some patients report noticeable effects for up to nine months. Why Dr. David Halpern?Don’t trust your face with just anyone! Dr. David Halpern is a triple-board-certified plastic surgeon in South Tampa with extensive credentials and experience using these products.

" 115 is the leading cosmetic procedure in America, with over 6.6 million injections done in 2014. More than 4 million people have opted for soft tissue dermal fillers and hyaluronic acid injections to soothe the effects of aging. Growing consumer education has fueled the popularity of such treatments, but plastic surgeons like  of  find that a number of people have “read something online” or “heard from a friend” these myths about injectables.While various injectable products reduce the appearance of wrinkles, they work in different ways: Botulinum Toxin A, Dysport and Xeomin are muscle relaxants that weaken the overactive muscles responsible for causing deep frown lines and eyebrow furrows to develop. Though they are derived from a toxin, the injectable is carefully purified and dosed out to provide the desired effect. By contrast,  like Juvederm, Radiesse, Perlane, Restylane, and Sculptraare made from gel-like substances that rest below the skin, adding lost volume, filling in wrinkles and often stimulating collagen production to restore smoothness to the skin.   People often take the leap into cosmetic procedures with Botox or a filler like Juvederm. Minimally invasive injections are a great way to plump thin lips, soften the appearance of creases and wrinkles, reduce scar appearance, and enhance natural contours. There is a limit to what one can achieve with injectables, however. “For some patients, surgery such as a facelift, brow lift, or eye lift may be the best approach,” states the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  Tighten or repair lax skinReposition deep tissuesFix saggy jowls or Also, keep in mind, injection results do not last anywhere near as long as , so if you’re not willing to come in for regular maintenance as you would with hair highlights, then a facelift may be the better option. Booking a consultation with Dr. David Halpern can help you explore the pros and cons. Needles scare a lot of people, but cosmetic injections are nothing like getting a tetanus shot at the doctor’s office. Only a small amount of liquid is delivered, so the needle used is rather small. After a small “pinch,” the redness fades quickly, with little to no swelling and bruising. Though pain tolerances vary, most people would rate it 2.5 on a 1 to 10 pain scale. Sometimes doctors use local anesthetic or a topical numbing agent, but fillers like Juvederm already contain Lidocaine to decrease discomfort. When you receive your injection from a highly trained and experienced professional, you’ll find injectables are a nearly pain-free experience. Everyone wants a natural enhancement that leaves them looking more youthful and refreshed. Newer recommendations regarding dosage and optimal injection locations have made it easier for trained professionals to deliver natural results for their patients. The majority of patients achieve natural results by seeking a qualified plastic surgeon to perform the injection and following important instructions. For instance, to avoid bruising and swelling, patients are instructed to avoid medications like Advil, Aleve and Aspirin that thin the blood for a week before and after the injection. On rare occasions, celebrities seek too many injections, leading to that stereotypical “overdone” look. Unscrupulous surgeons may advocate multiple types of fillers when they aren’t necessary just to make more money. While using more than one filler is recommended in some cases, it’s not the proper solution for every patient. A good plastic surgeon knows the difference. When done correctly and in proper moderation, injections diminish wrinkles, while still allowing room for expressivenessSome people think “Botox is Botox. You can get it for $100 at a spa, or pay a lot more to get it from a doctor.” While there is a set price for Botox set by manufacturer Allergan, you will sometimes see deep discounts offered by people with less training or – worse yet – crooks offering fake, adulterated Botox. Keep in mind, some fillers simply cost more because they last longer. Those rare catastrophic results we hear about in the news are often caused by a lack of medical training and improper technique.   Some fillers can last up to a year, but Botox only lasts three months. Repeated injections are necessary to maintain the results. If patients are 100% satisfied with the results from Juvederm and Restylane, a reversing agent called hyaluronidase can break up the hyaluronic acid and immediately eliminate the effects. Sun exposure without adequate protection can also diminish the length of time the product lasts. While patients are advised not to work out for 24 hours after their injections, it is a myth that exercise decreases the effectiveness of dermal fillers and Botox injections. If you are looking for a more permanent solution, a surgical facelift is another option to consider. +1",Top Myths About Injectables You Need to Know,"Blog,Injectables,News","November 23, 2015",

"The nature of life is such that one day you could be walking down the street at the top of your game, and the next you could be attacked by a dog that broke loose from a yard — and suddenly you’re living in the shadows, too embarrassed to be seen in public.Plastic surgery isn’t always about fundamentally changing a person’s characteristics as the media would lead you to believe. Sometimes it’s about re-creating what has been lost and helping a person restore their sense of self-confidence and dignity after a traumatic experience.There is something symbolic about helping victims of crime or accidents restore their bodies, while also healing the anxieties, frustrations and emotional scars. Truly remarkable reconstructive work is a combination of skill, experience and artistry – and, as a triple-board-certified Tampa plastic surgeon,  possesses all three. He received board certification from the American Board of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, as well as the  in: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, General Surgery and Micro-Hand Surgery.5 Types of Reconstructive Surgery Available At Tampa Bay Plastic SurgeryHere is more information on a few of his specialties:Hand SurgeryHand surgeries are one of the most common types of reconstructive surgery, with about 100,000 procedures done a year. A reconstructive surgeon often has to repair broken bones and torn tendons or ligaments, release trapped nerves, address joint degeneration, and reattach missing fingers. Since participating in a one-year fellowship at the world-renowned Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, Dr. David Halpern has been part of the on-call “complex hand trauma team” at Tampa General Hospital for over 15 years.Laceration RepairMore than 100,000 laceration repairs are done in America following blunt trauma or cuts from sharp objects. These surgeries are most commonly performed on the face, scalp and hands. Deep cuts that can’t be healed with bandages are treated surgically with sutures. Sometimes the cuts go beyond superficial skin with the need for deep repair of tendons, nerves, muscle and bone. Dr. Halpern regularly attends advanced training sessions in the latest tissue regeneration and skin grafting techniques.Reattachment SurgeryThe reattachment of severed fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms and legs requires repair of bones, soft tissues, nerves, arteries, veins and blood vessels. Injuries from military combat, workplace accidents involving heavy machinery, or motor vehicle crashes are common cause for lost limbs. Cancer and birth defects are other reasons to require reattachment surgery. Timing is crucial in these cases. Ideally, Dr. David Halpern likes to see patients within six hours of the traumatic incident. While the replanted part will never be 100%, the goal of reattachment surgery is to restore as much use as possible, with 60-80% functionality considered a favorable result.Facial Reconstructive SurgeryAbout 90,000 facial reconstructive surgeries are done to the head and neck each year. Facial surgery may be necessary due to trauma, disease, violence, athletic injuries, motor vehicle accidents, old scars that healed improperly, or congenital deformities like cleft lip and palate. The brain, eye, spinal cord and jaw may be affected as well. Since so much is at stake with scarring, nerve damage, tear or salivary duct injury possible, it is important you see a true expert in human anatomy. Dr. David Halpern traveled to Haitiafter the 2010 earthquake and performed 100 pro bono surgeries in one week to treat acute trauma, burns, gunshot wounds, tumors, and cleft lip/palate deformities.Dog Bite SurgeryDog bites land 800,000 Americans in the emergency room each year. The rate of infection is 15 times greater due to the amount of bacteria in a dog’s mouth that penetrates directly to deep tissues. Surgical repair requires removal of contaminated, injured tissue, thorough irrigation with saline and antibiotic solution, suturing, skin grafting, and advanced scar minimizing techniques.A Reconstructive Surgeon In Tampa You Can TrustDon’t leave your recovery to chance with any old surgeon.

" 89This year, South Tampa was ranked one of “The 10 Sexiest Neighborhoods in America” by . According to the editors, Tampa is full of “the hottest young people in Florida” who don’t want to live in Miami. As you know, people aren’t always born sexy… nor do they remain that way throughout all the stages of life. Many local residents come to renowned plastic surgeons like Dr. David Halpern to have maintenance work done. Wondering what the top sellers are? The top four plastic surgery procedures requested in his South Tampa office include:Breast AugmentationDr. David Halpern has performed thousands of successful breast augmentation surgeries over the past 15 years. Breast augmentation is done to enhance the volume of the breast and is sometimes done alongside a breast lift, which combats sagging related to age or childbearing by tightening the skin around the breasts to lift them higher. There are essentially three types of augmentation: conventional saline implants, newer gel “gummy” style implants (like Allergan’s Natrelle), and fat transfer using one’s own fat. The type of procedure done depends upon the condition of the breast and the desired look, which can be determined through a confidential patient consultation. The results are immediately visible and the recovery time is a short two weeks. Get more information on breast augmentation here.LiposuctionLiposuction body contouring has come a long way in recent years. Dr. David Halpern is current with all the latest techniques to provide amazing results in the abs, butt, hips, thighs, neck, arms, chin, cheeks, knees, calves and ankles. He may use the tumescent technique, which infuses targeted fat cells with saline and anesthetic for easy removal, or ultrasound-assisted liposuction, which uses a probe and lasers to quickly liquefies fat cells, especially in larger, more fibrous areas. The LiLa Strawberry Laser is another revolutionary technology employed by Dr. David Halpern to melt 1-3 inches of fat from a patient using only lasers. Some patients combine liposuction with other procedures like the Brazilian Butt Lift, Breast Augmentation or Facelift to restore missing volume in all the right places. Get more information on liposuction here or learn more about Tummy TuckOften, diet and exercise are simply not enough to remove pockets of persistent abdominal fat such as “love handles” and lower belly “pouches.” A tummy tuck procedure removes excess skin and fat from the abdomen, in addition to tightening muscle fascia like an internal corset, for full contouring that restores a more youthful, attractive body shape. It is done in about 2-4 hours under general anesthesia with a quick two-week recovery and results evident within a few months when swelling subsides completely. Candidates include people who have lost a lot of weight, those who have become more sedentary due to injury, and mothers who are done having children. Men come in asking about abdominoplasty as the final missing link to restore their body image after improving muscle tone in other areas. Often, the tummy tuck is combined with other procedures like liposuction and breast augmentation. Get more information on tummy tucks.RhinoplastyThe nose is a unique, yet prominent, facial feature. Changing this one aspect of the face often has dramatic results that boost self-esteem considerably when done by a true artist like Dr. David Halpern. He has helped transform hundreds of noses to enhance Tampa Bay patients’ natural beauty. During this procedure, cartilage and bone are reconstructed through tiny incisions within the nostrils, under general anesthesia. Twilight anesthesia may be used for mild reshaping procedures focused on just the tip of the nose. Most people are back to work in 7-10 days and are enjoying their new look a month later. Some patients get rhinoplasty done in conjunction with facelifts or skin resurfacing work.

"Though the number of breast augmentations dropped 1 percent last year, it was still the #1 plastic surgery procedure in the United States with 286,254 successful operations performed. Today’s implants come in saline or silicone gel, with the new “gummy bear” silicone implants quickly growing in popularity for their excellent results and safety profile. At RealSelf, You may be one step closer to having the procedure done yourself, but are held back by one of these misconceptions.  exposes common myths and illuminates the truth about .Most women get breast implants to have big racks and attract mates. Some women worry about what others will think of them if they get implants. Images of Pamela Anderson and Heidi Montag may immediately come to mind when you think of breast augmentation, but these busty, high profile women are in the minority. The biggest demographic for breast augmentation procedures are women who are married with two kids and an average age of 34. Breasts are comprised of fat and connective tissues, so the most popular way to replace lost volume related to childbearing is to get implants. Women do not always opt for bigger breasts. Many are just replacing the volume that has been lost and get the added benefit of a lift with them. In Florida, women do tend to go more toward C or D cups, but Dr. David Halpern works with each individual patient to determine which size and shape will best complement the woman’s physique.   We use pictures that the patient brings in to assist with meeting their personal goals and to ensure good communication between Dr. Halpern and the patient.A “C” cup is the ideal standard for breast implants.Women come in all shapes and sizes – from AAA to KK and beyond. Women’s breasts are getting bigger over time. Within the last five years, the average bra size has gone from 36C to 36DD. Many women come in asking for a specific cup size, but that measure can be misleading because different lingerie manufacturers have slightly different size standards. It’s also difficult to predict the precise cup size following a reduction or augmentation due to the shape of the breast. Breast implants are measured by cubic centimeter and are selected based on patient height, width and proportions. Some doctors use  imaging to give patients a better idea of what the enhanced size may look like on the body. Dr. David Halpern will work with you to find the right proportions. The best time to get a breast augmentation is after the breasts are done growing in my teens.There is no standard age for having breast augmentation surgery. The perfect time can range from 18 to 50, depending on how you feel about your figure. Development has little to do with the equation. While a woman’s skeletal system may finish growing sometime in her teenage years, a woman’s breasts continue to develop through her mid-twenties and continue to change all the way through menopause! Some women develop their breasts as early as 8-12 years of age, while others may be late bloomers. Sometimes the breasts appear pointy before they fill out or one breast seems to develop faster than the other – and all that is perfectly normal. In 2013, more than 8,234 saline breast augmentations were performed on 18-to-19-year-olds. To receive silicone implants, the FDA requires women to be at least 22 years of age, since this newer type of implant has not been clinically tested or cleared for routine use  in younger women.Breast augmentation will make my breasts perkier and younger looking.Enhance the contour of a small breastRestore lost volume related to weight loss or pregnancyAchieve better symmetry for disproportionate sizes and shapesImprove the feel of breasts that have lost firmness over timeProvide the foundation of breast contour following cancer removalCorrect congenitally disfigured, asymmetric or injured breastsI won’t be able to breastfeed my baby if I get breast implants.If you plan to have a baby within the next year or so, it would be wise to postpone implant surgery. However, if you want to get implants now and decide to have children down the road, there will be no consequence as far as breastfeeding is concerned. (You may just need an additional lift later on if the breast tissue stretches or shrinks considerably during and after your pregnancy!)There are many ways to approach breast augmentation. Any “horror stories” you may hear are likely related to subglandular procedures where the nerves or glands were somehow damaged. By contrast, Dr. David Halpern uses a different technique that places implants under the breast crease or near the armpit and thus avoiding nipple incisions. As the International Breastfeeding Centre of Canada states: “There is no evidence that breastfeeding with silicone implants is harmful to the baby.” As long as the operation is not done through the areola, there will be no problems with milk supply or letdown.Breast implants need to be replaced every 10 years.Nearly every patient has heard this rumor. However, there are many women who have had implants placed 30 years ago who are still just as happy with their results. The shelf life of breast implants is typically 10 to 15 years, but that is by no means an “expiration date.” There is no need for “maintenance” if you are still pleased with your implants after that time.About 20-40 percent of women will opt for an additional procedure years down the road to adjust the size or get a lift. After all, breast augmentation cannot compensate for genetics, environmental factors like sun exposure, or the natural effects of aging. Dr. David Halpern asks that all patients come back in for a checkup at regular intervals to ensure their continued satisfaction.Silicone breast implants often rupture and may cause cancer.There have been a select number of sensationally reported implant rupture cases, but they are the exception rather than the rule. FDA studies concluded that the rate of rupture was 10.1% for Allergan implants after 10 years and 13.6% for Mentor implants after 8 years. Three-quarters of these cases were symptomatic and addressed before an actual rupture occurred. Today’s implants are tested to withstand 25 times the force of a standard mammogram without failure, so you will still be able to have regular screenings without worry. As Skin Mag Online reports, “Silicone gel implants are among the most studied medical devices with well-proven safety records. Numerous studies have shown that there’s no evidence linking medical silicone to cancer, neurological disease or connective tissue disorders.”Breast augmentation surgery is very painful and I’ll need a lot of time off work.The surgery itself is done in 1-2 hours, as an outpatient procedure, under general anesthesia, so you’ll need someone to drive you home afterward but you won’t feel a thing. While individual pain tolerance levels vary, when done correctly, breast augmentation procedure recovery causes only mild discomfort for a day or two. Dr. David Halpern occasionally uses Exparel — a breakthrough, non-narcotic local anesthetic that provides 48 hours of pain relief – as well as gentle, minimally traumatic surgical techniques to get you back to a normal, non-strenuous routine within a day, without the need for pain medications like Vicodin or Percocet. Patients are generally back to work in 4-7 days. Three weeks after surgery, you’ll be able to do lower body exercises, walk and ride a stationary bike. By six weeks, most women are comfortable enough to resume arm and chest exercises as well as running (usually unrestricted at that time).Breast augmentation results are visible immediately.During breast augmentation surgery, the muscles react by tightening, which causes the resting position to be a little higher than normal. The chest tissue will look a little swollen. Depending on the patient, true results are visible approximately 8-12 weeks after surgery when swelling completely subsides and the breasts settle into a more natural position. For this reason, Dr. David Halpern recommends that patients plan their breast augmentation procedure well in advance of a major event like a wedding, pageant, milestone reunion or other special occasion.Breast implants are obviously fake and everyone will be able to tell.Obviously, hundreds of thousands of women would not be electing to have this surgery done if the implants did not look and feel real. Modern implants have come a long way in shape and texture. Choosing a board-certified plastic surgeon like Dr. David Halpern will help you get the natural look that best fits your body type. The initial shape, size, volume and symmetry of the patient’s natural breasts.The experience, skill level and certifications of the surgeon attending to you.The type of implant specially selected for shape, size and texture.The way and level the implants are filled or positioned. Bigger breasts will give me the perfect body.Having realistic expectations prior to breast augmentation surgery is just as important as the decision to have the procedure done at all. Unless you’re having corrective work done or a lift, breast augmentation will merely accentuate and enhance what you already have. A larger bust can make your waist appear smaller and your hips look more shapely, but it will not get rid of cellulite or give you a Victoria’s Secret model body.  is happy to discuss any additional procedures to help you reach your ideal standards of beauty, but keep in mind that happiness ultimately comes from within.

" 90Why should beautiful breasts be a thing of the past? , cares for a number of mature women who are looking for a body boost well into their 50s and 60s. Though the media fixates on the 20-something-year-old vixen going from an A-cup to DDs that stereotype does not fit the majority of Dr. David Halpern’s my patients.Most of his patients are in their thirties and forties, but he is seeing a growing number of mature women inquiring about breast augmentation. TheAmerican Society of Plastic Surgeons states that women over 55 account for 2% of , with nearly 7,000 procedures performed on mature women a year. Close to a quarter of all cosmetic surgery patients are 55+.Close to a quarter of all cosmetic surgery patients are 55+. Here are 10 reasons why you should consider breast augmentation after 50.Click To TweetIf you have taken care of yourself, you may find that you feel better than ever during the golden years. With fewer obligations nagging at you and more time for yourself, you may have more leisure time than ever. Why let the perils of aging pull you down? Diet and exercise can only take you so far. Even with a trim waistline, you may feel like the toll of motherhood, time and gravity have caused sagging, wrinkling and loss of shape. You’ve sacrificed enough. Let new breasts take years off your appearance.Traumatic accidents and lumpectomies can hurt the self-confidence of women over fifty. You may have beat the illness, but it may feel hard to face your reflection every day when you are left missing a part of yourself. Breast implants can be done at the same time as a mastectomy so you can feel healed sooner, rather than later.  The middle years of life can be tough on women due to childbearing, overworking, and stress. It can take years to figure out the best individual path to losing 10, 20, 30 or more pounds. Once you get there, the results can be disappointing – particularly if you lose volume in the breast along with those shed pounds or if you are left with saggy skin. Cosmetic surgery can help with those concerns.With no children living at home and no more breastfeeding to do, now is the perfect time to get the full-figured shape you’ve always wanted. Nothing is holding you back. If you are retired, you will be able to take as much recovery time as you want, without guilt.Skilled plastic surgeons are not only using saline and silicone implants, but they are also using fat transfers from the patient’s own body, when appropriate. In older patients, they are able to combine augmentation with a lift for breasts that are larger and shapelier – but also uplifted, perkier and younger. Sometimes a lift is all that is needed to achieve the desired outcome.Implants are a long-lasting cosmetic improvement, but younger patients may need to replace their implants later in life. The first 10 years are the best years for an implant. Dr. David Halpern likes to see his patients periodically after that to be sure the outer shell has not started to deteriorate or leak. Ruptures are extremely rare, but the risk increases after 25 years.Except for the case of reconstructive breast surgery, insurance does not cover the cost of breast implants. Older women typically have better access to financial resources to spend on elective surgery, whether it’s from savings, a CareCredit account, retirement income, or another source. Once the kids are out of college, there are fewer demands on a mother’s income as well. Dr. David Halpern’s office works with all patients prior to surgery to find the most affordable payment method.Life has a way of throwing a real curveball at you, just when you think you’ve hit your stride. You may be considering a late-stage career change and want to look as lively as you feel. Or you may suddenly find yourself re-entering the dating market after becoming widowed or divorced. Breast implants can help you feel more confident that you’re the total package. You may have felt that your clothes never quite fit right due to the size of your breasts. That is one of the primary reasons women seek out implants, according to  of real breast implant patients. What kind of a grandmother do you want to be? One who looks smart in the latest fashions while she’s out with the grandkids? Or one who is trapped in stereotypical sweatpants and velour tracksuits?As we get older, we become more certain of what we want in life.

" 97 is committed to helping people live more rewarding and productive lives with a quick procedure that alleviates carpal tunnel syndrome suffering.What Is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?The “carpal tunnel” is a narrow canal in the wrist, formed by the carpal bones on the sides and a strong ligament on top. A rope of tendons and the median nerve passes through the space, connecting the forearm muscles to the hand bones. It’s this structure that allows our thumb and fingers to bend and straighten. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the tendons swell and put pressure on the nerve. Symptoms Of Carpal Tunnel SyndromeCarpal tunnel causes:PainNumbness Burning, and Weakness in the hands and wrist. Mild cases feel more like soreness, while more severe cases can feel like “burning” or “constant pins and needles.”Who Gets Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?Women are 3x more likely to get carpal tunnel syndrome than men.Carpal tunnel typically only affects adults, usually in their 40s and 50s.People with diabetes and metabolic syndromes are at an increased risk.It is especially common among assemblers, cleaners, seamstresses, meat-packers, and office workers.It has been estimated that carpal tunnel syndrome affects 4-10 million Americans.   Carpal Tunnel TreatmentsPhysicians usually tell individuals suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome to rest and avoid the repetitive motions that caused the overuse injury in the first place. Anti-inflammatories and direct application of ice may be used to take down swelling. Strength training exercises overseen by a physical therapist may be recommended. A doctor can inject corticosteroids into the wrist to provide immediate pain relief, but this does not address the root cause.Carpal tunnel release surgery is one of the most common surgeries in the United States – recommended for anyone whose symptoms last more than six months. Benefits of Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release The  was introduced in 2013 as a minimally invasive approach to relieve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. Unlike the traditional “open release” surgery, which requires the use of many different tools, this system has micro tools attached to one device. Dr. David Halpern makes a tiny incision and inserts the disposable tool, which includes a tiny endoscopic camera, a scope-mounted blade, and a cannula attached to a revolver tab handle he uses intuitively to take the necessary actions. This advanced system allows the best possible visualization of the hand anatomy for more accuracy. Additional benefits of Stratos Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release include:The Stratos system has a clinical success rate of 98%.The smaller the incision, the less risk of infection and scarring.Wounds are closed using adhesive and a modest dressing, rather than stitches.– Surgical relief of carpal tunnel immediately resolves the root cause of trouble.The risk of nerve damage is less than 1% for endoscopic carpal tunnel release.Can be done using local anesthetic, rather than general, in less than an hour. You can take comfort knowing the surgeon is using the latest technology. – Patients are advised to avoid heavy lifting for 4-6 weeks, but most people are using their affected hand(s) the same day and return to work in 7-14 days.Your hands are one of the most important parts of your body.

The gummy bear consistency ensures that the implant stays in place, plus, these specific types of implants are much less likely to rupture or bleed overtime.So, what exactly is gummy about the gel? Gummy implants include a highly cohesive gel, which means that the gel has a gummy-like consistency that sticks together and holds it shape. The cohesive gel implants are “form stable” and maintain the shape that they are placed in and resist changes that other previous implants would normally deform from. Although cohesive gel implants have been on the market for many years, the new round shaped implants have been recently introduced to the industry, which is a major step forward in cosmetic augmentation candidates.

" 215Many consumer articles focus on the importance of researching board-certified plastic surgeons with experience in the particular procedure a patient is seeking. While this is one of the most important predictors of outcome, any good plastic surgeon will explain that lifestyle factors play a huge role in mitigating short-term complications and ensuring long-term satisfaction. Before meeting with a qualified surgeon, Tampa Bay’s  recommends considering the following factors that make or break a candidate for plastic surgery procedures.About 45% of board-certified plastic surgeons limit the types of procedures they perform on smokers, according toa 2002 survey conducted by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Nicotine and carbon dioxide decrease blood and oxygen supply to the tissues, which impairs healing. Smoking also impairs the pulmonary system, increasing the risk ofserious surgical complications. Most surgeons require patients to stop smoking for a period — usually at least a month — before and after surgery.The poor circulation, nutrient deficiencies and impaired immune system functioning often associated with obese patientsimpairs healing. The ideal plastic surgery candidate is within 30 percent of his or her ideal Body Mass Index. Patient satisfaction is another consideration for obese patients. For instance, surgeons find a high level of success with patients looking to correct an isolated oversized body part (such as the panniculus abdominal flab or disproportionately large breasts). However,patients looking to completely  through excisional surgery and  are often disappointed if they do not lose some weight on their own prior to surgery. They are also more apt to re-gain fat if healthy eating and exercise habits are not demonstrated. Alcohol consumption affects plastic surgery results inseveral ways: – Alcohol dilates blood vessels and dehydrates / boosts water retention.– Alcohol thins the blood, causing more bleeding.– Heavy alcohol use disrupts cell migration and collagen deposition.– Alcohol interferes withmany pain drugs. – Alcohol increases risks of internal bleeding and breathing failure.Each shot increases urine production by four ounces, which leads to dehydration. Patients with dehydrated skin take longer to heal and also look much older.Alcohol also affects the long-term success of plastic surgery. A2009 study of twins by Dr. Bahman Guyuron found that “the twin who avoided alcohol looked significantly younger.” Most surgeons recommend abstaining from alcohol for at least two weeks prior to surgery and limiting alcohol intake afterward to maintain results.Limiting or avoiding sun exposureis particularly important for , , forehead lifts, scar removal surgery, , . The sun can increase the amount of swelling, inflammation and bleeding after surgery. Changes to skin pigmentation caused by the sun can also increase the risk of scarring, not to mention contribute to premature aging. Dr. Guyuron’s study of twins also found that the twin who spent less time in the sun looked significantly younger. Some doctors recommend keeping the scars out of the sun for as long as a year after a procedure.Sleep deprivation can affect plastic surgery patients in countless ways. For instance, a patient coming in for blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) may not get the results they hope for if they continue to get insufficient sleep. Lack of sleepcauses the blood vessels to dilate, disrupts new collagen and skin cell formation, decreases skin elasticity, and acceleratesthe tear trough crease under the eye along the bony rim by accelerating loss of fat in the face. Furthermore, how you sleep may affect anti-aging results.The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery recommends that patients sleep on their backs following facelift surgery or wrinkle-reducing treatment. Experts believe that sleeping on your stomach or one side contributes to wrinkle formation. Ideally, patients will use soft bedding materials with soft pillowcases that have a high thread count. Dr. David Halpern includes sleep solutions in his consultations to provide you with the best action plan for plastic surgery recovery. Certain foods and drinkshave been found to interfere with anesthesia, bleeding time, immune function and healing times and should be avoided for at least one week prior to surgery, including:Omega 3 and fish oil supplementsGreen teaCayenne PepperGingko bilobaGarlic GingerFlaxseedTomatoesPotatoesEggplantAlcoholCaffeineAspartameMSGNSAID drugs like AspirinMultivitaminsIngesting the proper nutrients can aid in healing. Post-operative patients need sufficient: Vitamin A for immune functioning, epithelial and bone formation and cellular differentiation; Vitamin C for collagen formation and antioxidant power; Vitamin E for cell differentiation and inflammatory response; as well as protein, glutamine and arginine for wound repair. Patients areoften advised to consume: 5-6 small meals per day packed with protein from milk, eggs, meat, soy, yogurt or beansAt least 8 glasses of water per day to maintain hydrationCitrus fruits, potatoes and tomatoes for adequate vitamin CLeafy greens, carrots and chicken liver for Vitamin ACabbage and beets for glutamine and arginineLiberal intake of seasonal fruits for an assortment of micronutrientsA supplement of B vitamins, Vitamin E and/or Vitamin CFor many body contouring procedures, it’s important to continue a regular exercise program to avoid undoing your plastic surgery results. For instance,a study of 36 Brazilian women who underwent abdominal liposuction found that women who did not exercise saw a 10% increase in visceral fat six months later, compared to women who exercised three times a week. While exercise is important, it’s equally important that patients follow their surgeon’s specific instructions for when to resume physical activity. For instance, tummy tuck patients are usually advised to waitat least six weeks before resuming aerobic exercise and weight lifting. When they do get going again, they’re told to do less repetitions, less weight and a shorter duration of exercise to ease back into it. A number of physiological processes are affected by stress that delay wound healing. Stressed individuals have:Greater cortisol secretionsIncreased catecholamine productionLower circulating oxytocin levelsDiminished expression of proinflammatory cytokines at the wound siteReduced cell and leukocyte infiltration at the wound sitesDamaged blood vessels, which decreases oxygen availabilityReduced immune system functioning to prevent infection.All of these factors makes wounds slower to heal, which is a problem for plastic surgery patients. People who suffer from depression and anxiety are also more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors like drinking, smoking, staying up all night, eating poorly and reducing physical activity. Areview of research in 2011 published in the Journal ofImmunology and Allergy Clinics of North America found that psychological stress significantly delays healing more than medical status and sociodemographic variables. For instance:Gallstone surgery patients with more stress on the third postoperative day stayed in the hospital longer.Coronary artery surgery patients with more depressive symptoms were more likely to require rehospitalization.Coronary artery bypass patients with more depressive symptoms suffered more infections and poor healing. Patients with the highest depression and anxiety were four times more likely to have non-healing leg wounds.Likewise,a survey of more than 700 plastic surgery practices found that psychological issues following surgery were more common and problematic than physical complications. Consequences included “delayed recuperative times, delayed return to work, poor patient compliance, dissatisfaction with the surgical outcome, hostility toward surgeons, and anxiety.” While some stress is to be expected after any kind of medical procedure, an honest discussion with your plastic surgeon will help you develop realistic expectations for recovery and best prepare for the road ahead. A good plastic surgeon will keep tabs on your psychological health as you recover and suggest appropriate medical or therapeutic interventions if you are experiencing significant anxiety or depression.Dr. David Halpern is happy to work with you to discuss how to safely achieve your plastic surgery goals, given your lifestyle.

" 140Fat transfer is a hot topic in plastic surgery in 2015, but the first procedure dates back more than 100 years to 1983, when German physician Franz Neuber grafted upper arm fat to a patient’s cheek. Today, plastic surgeons use a patient’s own fat to restore volume and provide the most natural results for facelifts, breast augmentation, Brazilian butt lifts, hand rejuvenation, deformity repair and other body contouring procedures. Dr. David Halpern is a skilled triple-board-certified plastic surgeon adept in the latest, clinically-proven fat grafting techniques the industry has to offer. Fat grafting is a three-step procedure that takes two to four hours. First, a local anesthetic is applied and excess body fat is removed from a location such as the outer thighs, back, abdomen, buttocks or arms using a cannula connected to a syringe. Next, the fat is washed and purified in a centrifuge, then transferred into a micro-syringe.  Lastly, the surgeon carefully deposits the purified fat back into natural tissue planes in places like the face, hands, breasts, cheeks, chin or buttocks – and contoured using massage, bandaging or another placement technique. Over the years, improved techniques, revised application guidelines and more consumer attention paid to surgeon selection have taken RealSelf patient satisfaction levels from 40% to 84%.“Fat transfer procedures are very much surgeon-dependent,” explains Dr. David Halpern, who has worked with fat grafts since he graduated from New York University in 1987. Excellent candidates for fat transfer are in general good health with positive attitudes and realistic expectations. Ideally, you will have a robust circulatory system and no bleeding disorders. The choice to add fat grafting to your procedure depends on what you’re having done:works best for thin, aging faces afflicted by laugh lines, crow’s feet, forehead creases and nasolabial lines; restores volume loss around the eyes and in sunken cheek areas; hides acne scars and pits. works best for patients with good skin tone seeking a modest increase in size; ideal for filling in contour irregularities and restoring lost volume related to pregnancy or aging. works best for patients with 10 or so extra pounds of fat available for harvest, who desire a fuller, rounder buttocks without use of implants. improves skin quality, covers visible blood vessels and plumps up wrinkled areas.Fat grafting is the preferred method of plastic surgery for many patients and procedures. The results are safe, long-lasting and natural-looking. Some fat inevitably gets reabsorbed by the body, but patients with severe allergies do not have to worry about all-out rejection as they may with synthetic or bovine-derived components. When compared to traditional facelifts, fat transfer is less expensive with a recovery that is half to a third of the time. It can be done using local anesthesia, rather than general. When combined with a facelift, the results are more natural if lost volume is a factor in a patient’s aging. When compared to dermal fillers, fat transfers are longer-lasting and less likely to cause an allergic reaction. When compared to traditional breast augmentation, the scars are smaller and there is no need for implant in many cases. Fat grafting is especially useful in correcting deformities or abnormal breast shapes. For mastectomy patients, fat grafting is the only way to truly restore the quality of scarred, damaged and irradiated tissue.  When compared to butt implants, fat grafting provides a more natural look and feel. Also, there is less chance of complications such as: implant displacement, fluid collection or capsular contracture. When compared to dermal fillers, fat grafts last longer.Dr. David Halpern can perform fat transfer alongside the following procedures:FaceliftLiposuctionSkin ResurfacingBody ContouringDermal Fillers Like BotoxChin & Cheek AugmentationBrazilian Butt Lift & AugmentationIf you’re looking for the best fat transfer surgeon in Tampa FL, add Dr. David Halpern to your consideration.

Countless more have joined weight loss programs, ordered dietary supplements or started gym memberships to shed the pounds. However, losing 100 pounds or more is just the beginning of an uphill battle for the morbidly obese. After the fat comes off, stretched-out skin and disproportionate pockets of persistent fat cause physical and psychological issues to persist.

Last year,almost 45,000 Americans had body contouring done by plastic surgeons after weight loss, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. This number is expected to rise considerably as insurance coverage expands.On one hand, people are thrilled to have lost so much weight. On the other hand, all they see in the mirror is the flabby skin persisting. This excess skin goes beyond cosmetic unsightliness in many cases. I’m happy to offer a full suite of surgeries to help patients who have achieved their weight loss goals finally enjoy the fruits of their labor.Tatiana Bobbitt, a woman who lost 190 pounds, toldThe Huffington Postshe “lost motivation” because she couldn’t see the weight loss anymore; all she could see was her excess arm and groin skin that had become painful and infected. A recent study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery echoed this sentiment: Of 100 patients who had lost 100 pounds or more, those who did not have any cosmetic procedures ended up gaining back 50 pounds, compared to the 13 pounds gained by body contouring patients. Swiss researchers concluded that skin removal and body contouring procedures should be routine standard of care in the bariatric surgery process.“I felt gross when I saw myself naked and when it came to dating, it was a big insecurity,” Bobbitt recalled. Once her parents saw the extent of her infection, they agreed to help her pay for abdomen, arm and lower body lifts. Thanks to the surgery, Bobbitt is now a 210-pound married college graduate. Had she not have been able to get the plastic surgery procedures done, she says, “I think I would regret ever losing the weight in the first place.”Another plastic surgery success story can be seen inthe former “World’s Fattest Man,” Paul Mason of Ipswich, England, who traveled to NYC to have plastic surgery after losing 650 pounds, down from his original 980 pound weight. Expert surgeons removed 50 pounds of skin in a complex 9.5 hour operation. Prior to his surgery, he was confined to a wheelchair, unable to shower standing up, had no sensation in his feet and had to deal with “an apron of extra flesh” whenever he got into a pair of pants. Eventually, he plans to have one more operation to remove excess skin from his upper arms, but for now he is content being able to enjoy the daily pleasures of life once again. He says he is now able “to sit in a cinema seat for the first time in 30 years and hold hands and cuddle, like couples do.”   – Reduce extra underarm tissue and cellulite through a simple incision made in the armpit.

"Across the country Americans are deciding how to spend their tax refund. Many of them will opt for plastic surgery. According to the annual plastic surgery procedural statistics, there were 15.9 million surgical and minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures performed in the United States in 2015, a 2 percent increase over 2014.Eager to provide the predictions for 2016’s plastic surgery trends , industry professionals are surveying the innovations and techniques that rose to popularity in 2015. At , this has been an exciting year. We introduced  which offers Selective Waveband Technology and given hundreds of men and women the body of their dreams. Dr. David Halpern, a board-certified plastic surgeon, is looking forward to the coming year ahead, and expects the following procedures to expand in popularity in 2016.Okay, we’re not saying they are going away entirely. Breast lifts are up 89 percent since 2000. However, their popularity is significantly waning. Mirroring the change in celebrity ideals and fashion trends, more female patients are instead opting for smaller, more natural looking . Kylie Jenner, of course, isn’t the only celeb women have in mind when they think pouty lips. Angelina Jolie has long been the queen of the lip department. However, Jenner’s recent media attention has spurred a lip filler revival unlike anything we’ve ever seen. 2.4 million Soft Tissue Fillers were completed in 2015, up 6 percent from 2014. Lips are expected to be big in 2016 in every sense of the word.

Increased awareness of the neck and chin can be credited to the popularity of selfies and social media. And while women do dominate the population of those undergoing surgery, 2016 will show an increase in the number of male patients. That’s partially thanks to cosmetic procedures becoming less “taboo” for men as well as an increase in non-invasive surgeries. The interest in the female shape has been a historical obsession. What has changed over the centuries is the shape women desire.  are up a whopping 252 percent since 2000. These days it’s all about the butt. Butt enhancement surgeries were popular in 2015 and plastic surgeons expect to receive even more butt-related procedure requests in the coming year.

Over 80% of the almost 16 million  performed in 2015 were of the non-surgical type. Non-invasive procedures will continue to grow in popularity as they offer a method to remove fat without the need to undergo surgery.

"had 1.7 million cosmetic surgical procedures done in 2015. Deep in the Amazon region of Peru, there are small communities where people cannot pay for routine dental work or the most basic medical care, let alone plastic surgeries to correct birth defects, deformities and physical abnormalities.From June 10th-19th, Dr. David Halpern will travel with 62 people to Moyobamba, Peru –the Northern part of Peruvian Amazon, known for its 3,500 species of orchids, hot springs, gold, and cash crops.He will be working with the North Texas Chapter of the Peruvian American Medical Society, which was formed by a group of Peruvian physicians who wanted to improve medical care for the indigent in Peru. Since 2007, they have helped over 1,400 patients with more than 330 surgeries.The Yantalo Mission works out of a local medical clinic equipped with telemedicine, solar power and intelligent water use – actually, the first sustainable “green” clinic in Peru. All people of the region are served in the 16-bed international clinic by some of the best physicians from around the world, regardless of their ability to pay. The Yantalo Clinic & Diagnostic Center also trains Peruvian medical students.Last year, volunteer surgical teams from the Medical College of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan performed 11 congenital repairs in Peruvian children ranging from 2 months to 16 years of age. This part of Peru is known for having three times as many cases of cleft palate than is typically found here in America.In addition to the surgical work, the North Texas chapter of PAMS has been supporting orphanages in Ayacucho and Huancavelica with a bicycle donation program since 2013. Since the program began, over 100 bicycles have been given to children in need. Dr. Halpern is bringing his wife wife, Silvia, his mother-in-law, Florcita, as well as his youngest son, Noah, along on the mission to help out with that aspect of the program, take photographs of their time spent with the local people, and distribute everything from stuffed animals and colored pencils, to personal hygiene items.The Yantalo Mission will be the  Dr. David Halpern has made. In 2010, he traveled to Haiti to help Earthquake victims restore their physical appearances after suffering the worst earthquake to hit Haiti in a century. He was overwhelmed by the enormous need in the area six months following the disaster. We could work 24/7 and still not make a dent.During his mission in Haiti, Dr. Halpern performed dozens of procedures in makeshift operating rooms at the Port-au-Prince International Airport with limited tools. In addition to helping earthquake victims, his patients also included a group kids injured in a truck roll-over and a 16-year-old epileptic girl who suffered 30% total body surface burn and half a lost hand after being thrown into the fire to “exorcize her demons.”But it was exciting to be part of a team that needed to think and act quickly – and it reinforced for me the reasons I became a plastic surgeon in the first place. It may be tough, but the sense of having contributed to the greater good of humanity is a feeling that’s second to none.You can learn more about ",Dr. David Halpern Provides Free Surgeries for People of Need In Peru,"Blog,News","June 10, 2016",

Brazilian Butt Lift in Tampa: Why is it so popular and is it right for you?Types of Butt LiftsDepending on your need, Dr. David Halpern may recommend one of the following types of butt lift:This procedure gently suctions your own body fat from the abdomen, hips, thighs or back and uses it to naturally shape, fill out and enhance your bottom.Implants are another way to enhance volume. Products sold in the US are made of a soft solid silicone polymer, custom carved and sized by the surgeon to meet your needs. The surgeon removes some skin and fat in the love handle area. The skin of the buttocks is then pulled up and tightened. A full lift improves contour and skin quality.In many cases, surgeons combine augmentation and lift procedures for optimal results.Why is a Brazilian Butt Lift So Popular in Tampa FL?The sudden upswing in popularity for rear-end enhancement even has plastic surgeons surprised. “It’s just amazing, the numbers,” said Dr. Douglas Taranow, a fellow board-certified plastic surgeon who is based out of New York. “It’s with J. Lo, and Beyonce, and everyone else having a great derriere. … I think people see that and they want to mirror image it,” he toldNBC News.“It’s just amazing, the numbers. Dr. David Halpern says many of his patients see it as a great add-on to a procedure like liposuction or tummy tuck. “Many people come in wanting fat removed from their hips, thighs and abdomens anyway and they figure ‘Why not put it back where I need it and enhance my curves?’ Over the years, the fat grafting technique has really given surgeons a natural way to re-sculpt the body.”Other popular reasons to get a Brazilian butt lift include:To restore youth and combat age-related drooping.To fit better in jeans, shorts and sweatpants.To enhance the hourglass shape, especially when dressed in formalwear. To improve self-confidence from always having “no butt” or “a flat butt.”To look better in a bikini (especially in Miami where all the bodies are hot-hot-hot!)Are You a Good Butt Lift Candidate? include people who are not in good medical condition with heart, lung orneurological disorders. that cause increased bleeding (like Gingko Biloba, Ginseng and Fish Oil) may also be advised against any kind of surgery. You are at increased risk for complications from surgery if you possess a serious health problem, such as:AnemiaArthritis DiabetesDepressionHemophiliaHigh cholesterolHigh blood pressure Severe allergic reactionsIf you plan to have children within the next year or two, it is recommended that you hold off on the butt lift procedure, as there is no predicting where and how the body will gain fat during pregnancy. If you are young and want to look a certain way right now, another option is to have it done and simply come back in for touch-up work following your childbearing years.   Tips for Choosing a Butt Lift SurgeonEvery plastic surgeon has his or her own idea of what looks best on a patient. The best way to ensure you are on the same page with your doctor is to look at the before-and-after photos. Choose a surgeon who can deliver the look you find most attractive on a person. Brazilian butt lifts are very safe, provided that they are done by competent surgeons with fresh skill sets. Find a surgeon who strives to minimize scarring and who values patient satisfaction in every regard. Scheduling a one-on-one consultation is the best way to determine whether you will have a good rapport with a prospective surgeon or not. Go with your gut!Questions to Ask Before Getting a Butt LiftLook for someone certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, which is accredited by the Board of Medical Specialties and maintains the highest standards for Brazilian butt lifts. Be sure you’reaware of the differences between a “plastic” surgeon and a “cosmetic” surgeon.Ideally, your surgeon will be able to show you 10 or more patients with a diverse mix of different body types that demonstrate an understanding of human anatomy and the complexities involved in this kind of procedure. You can see two butt lift cases in Dr. David Halpern’sonline gallery, but he has more photos he can show you during a confidential consultation. Find a surgeon adept at liposuction, fat purification and injection. Each step of the process is equally important. You also want to know that all possible options for enhancing curves are available to you, so be sure your surgeon of choice has experience in dealing with implants as well.Typically, a Brazilian butt lift will take anywhere from four to seven hours to complete, with 2-3 hours allocated for liposuction and fat processing, and 3-4 hours for injecting and sculpting. Anyone quoting you less than four hours may be taking shortcuts that compromise safety and outcome. Realistic recovery usually involves wearing a compression garment and sit on a special cushion for two weeks. Most patients are back to work in two weeks and able to resume exercising in four weeks. The final result is typically observed after six weeks, when swelling and bruising go down.Remember that “the best results” for a butt lift are not necessarily in achieving a particular size or perfectly emulating the dimensions of a famous celebrity. Getting the best butt for YOU means achieving a desirable waist-hips-butt ratio and taking the whole body shape into consideration. For most butt augmentation procedures, about 70% of the fat transfer remains in place and 30% gets reabsorbed by the body. A skilled surgeon takes that into consideration when determining how much fat to remove and re-inject. The best surgeons do not have to perform a single re-do resulting from fat graft loss, but rather, perform a touch up here and there for the occasional patient who has gained significant weight or had children since the last surgery. That said, the surgeon should still have a clear policy pertaining to patient satisfaction.Schedule a Brazilian Butt Lift Consultation TodayIf you’re considering a , call  to schedule a consultation withDr. David Halpern.

" 99During the month of January, Tampa Bay Plastic Surgery is running specials on . Sometimes called a “Liquid Facelift,” these advanced dermal fillers act to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and folds, gently lifting facial features and restoring natural contours. As a result, patients enjoy a more rested, friendlier appearance. Botox and Xeomin injections can be used in conjunction to provide added lift, extend the lifespan of the fillers and (to some degree) prevent the formation of new wrinkles caused by involuntary facial spasms. The promotions Tampa Bay Plastic Surgery is running now allow our patients to receive discounted facial fillers and injectables without sacrificing safety or quality. All three offers must be redeemed in our Tampa office and will be injected by Dr. David Halpern himself.Radiesse is a FDA-approved implant injected below the surface of the skin for the correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds. Radiesse acts as a wrinkle filler. It plumps the skin around the injection site and adds volume under the skin over time. The benefits of Radiesse continue by naturally stimulating your body’s own natural collagen production. Radiesse is injected by Dr. David Halpern through a small needle and placed under the skin. It is done in a quick procedure that can be completed within the lunch hour.Natural results of Radiesse have been shown to last a year or more in many patients, making the treatment results both immediate and long lasting.Dysport is a FDA-approved injectable form of Botulinum Toxin A.Dysport is injected into wrinkle-causing muscles to, in a sense, “paralyze” them. Unlike fillers, which rehabilitate volume, this injection works to temporarily incapacitate the muscles responsible for involuntary facial spasms that create undesirable wrinkles. Treatment areas include fine lines and wrinkles such as crow’s feet, deep forehead creases, and furrows between the eyebrows. Your Dysport treatment can be done during one visit for a single price. It is administered by Dr. David Halpern using a thin needle at the treatment site.  The treatment is visibly noticeable within two to three days and generally lasts from three to six months. However, some patients report noticeable effects for up to nine months. Sculptra is a FDA-approved dermal stimulator that works to stimulate your skin’s natural growth and collagen production. The Sculptra filler is made from poly-L-lactic acid, which is the same type of material used in dissolvable stitches.  Results emerge subtly to give you a more natural looking appearance. Sculptra works to target collagen loss. Through increased collagen production, the areas of the face which have lost volume thicken to produce a refined, more youthful looking appearance. These areas include nasolabial folds a.k.a “smile lines,” “marionette lines” which frame your mouth, and chin wrinkles. The Sculptra filler works gradually in a series of treatments (usually 3) over a period of a few months. However, the number of sessions and vials depends upon the patient’s condition. How many sessions you need will be determined at your patient consultation. Sessions are typically spaced 4-6 weeks apart.The results of Sculptra usually develop over three to six months following injection. However, some people report effects lasting up to two years. Dr. David Halpern is an exceptional surgeon, with unparalleled expertise and training. He is board certified in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, General Surgery, and Micro-Hand Surgery, demonstrating the depth of his skill set. This level of skill and ability guarantees his patients receive nothing but the most outstanding patient care and professionalism.

"Dr. David Halpern is pleased to offer the latest technology to reduce cellulite, improve skin firmness and smooth skin surface – without plastic surgery or liposuction. Reaction by Viora uses radio frequencies and vacuum therapy to encourage new collagen production, tighten existing collagen matrixes, and remove small pockets of unwanted cellulite. Viora is safe to use around the eyes since it is not light based without risk to damage to eyes and in deeply pigmented skin or suntanned skin without risk of pigment changes or burns.  An age between 30 and 65 Mild to moderate skin laxityWrinkled or dimpled skinSome orange peel or cottage cheese like fat, but not huge rollsReaction by Viora is the first and only FDA-approved multi-channel radio frequency treatment for cellulite and skin sagging. This versatile technology can be used in different ways, depending on what mode or body part is being treated. Generally speaking, it is a noninvasive treatment that uses a combination of radio frequencies and vacuum therapy. Thinner areas like the forehead are treated with a high frequency, while thicker areas like the cheeks and back are treated with lower multi-channel modes. To remove cellulite, subcutaneous tissue layers are heated to shrink fat cell volume, stimulate lymphatic drainage, prompt collagen and elastin production, and enhance blood circulation. From the patient’s vantage point, an applicator is massaged externally over the treatment area in slow, concentrated motions.Unlike plastic surgery, there is no recovery time with Viora treatments. You can come in on your lunch break and go right back to work. Patients for cellulite reduction say they feel “a bit toasty” like they’ve been tanning – or as though they have just been in for “a deep tissue massage.” Patients for skin tightening feel “alternating sensations of heating and cooling,” but it is not painful. If you are feeling a bit sensitive, the doctor can adjust the frequency to a more comfortable level. Some patients have a little redness or slight bruising, but those are the only side effects reported.  Each session varies from 30 minutes to an hour. The number of sessions are based on individual need. For most patients:4-8 treatments (scheduled 2-3 weeks apart) are needed for skin tightening8 treatments (scheduled 1 week apart) are needed for cellulite reductionDiet and exercise can help you maintain your looks, but you may wish to come in for maintenance every 6-12 months for continued collagen renewal and the best possible results.Patients interviewed by Redbook said:“The improvement is substantial. By the fourth or fifth treatment, my pants fit better.” “I’m not flat by any means, but my abs finally have some definition.” “Even though RF doesn’t melt fat, by tightening that loose skin, it can shrink the circumference of the area.” “Seeing such a dramatic change in my stomach motivated me to get healthier all around.”Schedule a Viora consultation in Tampa, FL with , a triple-board-certified plastic surgeon, by calling  or contact us here.

"Plastic surgery numbers continue to grow, year after year. Consumers are confident that the benefits outweigh the risks and that the combination of technology and technique offers them a safe way to reach their aesthetic goals. However, all surgeons are NOT equal. As you shop around for your next plastic surgeon, look for board certification by the ., president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), explains that all their certified surgeons receive specialized training in how to effectively deal with known potential problems such as fat embolisms.Furthermore, ASPS-certified plastic surgeons must have at least six years of professional medical training and pass two rigorous exams. It takes a good seven to eight years to become board-certified, he toldHealthline.Doctors claim to be “board certified,” but simply lie and don’t actually possess the credentials. Doctors don’t say which board did the certifying. (The American Board of Medical Specialties does not accredit all boards like ASPS!) Some boards give out “certification” for a small fee.Doctors don’t say what they’re board certified IN. “There are a lot of pseudo boards, someone can be board certified in internal medicine and still call himself or herself a cosmetic surgeon and still say that they’re a board certified cosmetic surgeon,” Dr. Song clarifies.To cut overhead costs, some surgeons elect to perform cosmetic procedures in non-licensed facilities. Surgeons who are willing to cut corners with so-called “office surgeries” may have issues with local accredited surgery centers or banned from doing surgery at local hospitals, so it could be a red flag. Accredited surgical facilities guarantee:They report all complications or infections to the medical board and health department.Emergency protocols for fires, disastrous weather and emergencies are in place.The physician’s license is not revoked or suspended. They meet industry’s best patient care standards for equipment, staffing and food.List your patient rights and responsibilities somewhere visible. Drug and medication expiration dates and supplies are not lapsed. Your surgeon’s peers monitor and review him or her continuously for quality assurance purposes.Anesthesia standards have been set and are only performed by licensed anesthesiologists.There are exceptionally low rates for serious complications and mortality. Note that ALL American Society of Plastic Surgery member surgeons MUST use fully accredited, state-licensed facilities for all procedures. You need not look far to find stories of unqualified surgeons completely botching the complex task of plastic surgery. Here are a few headlines that caught our attention:Australian Man Dies Days After Traveling To Malaysia For Cheaper Plastic SurgeryDeath Raises Concerns About the Risks of Plastic Surgery, a 29-year-old West Virginia woman and mother of two, had a  at a South Florida clinic. She died from a fat embolism and heart defect complication following the procedure. According toNBC News, “The state board that regulates doctors has accused him of botching plastic surgeries while working at other clinics, and has restricted what procedures he can perform. Dr. Omulepu is fighting efforts to have his license revoked. The clinic’s website states they have “board certified surgeons with experience.” But newspaper reporters could not find any of the doctors on theBoard-Certified Plastic Surgeon Finder.Mother of Girl Brain-Damaged By Plastic Surgery Warns About ClinicsThe doctor who administered her anesthesia had an active license. But had spent 30 months in prison after “peddling drugs” online. He was a defendant in a medical malpractice suit following buttock augmentation.Beauty blogger is left ‘looking like a burns victim’ after laser surgery to remove a small birthmark on her cheek goes wrong It’s not just invasive surgeries that are capturing headlines. , a 23-year-old beauty blogger, wanted to have a small birthmark on her cheek removed. She thought it would be a quick laser procedure. After the procedure she wound up with severe burns that have produced visible scars years later. “I was shaking and terrified,” she said after her third procedure. “It looked like someone took a hot coal to my face and burned me.” She later found out that same surgeon burned someone while doing laser hair removal. “People need to do extensive research on who they are choosing to go to,” she concluded.As theMiami Heraldpoints out, state budgets are often slashed so much that consumers are essentially left to fend for themselves. About 1,500 positions (particularly county health agency jobs) were cut under Governor Rick Scott’s latest budget. At the same time, the Florida Department of Health saw its budget reduced by $57 million. The best you can do is:Get all available information you can from the Florida Department of Health’s Medical Quality Assurance search service. Look up disciplinary actions for any surgeon you’re considering.Verify a surgeon’s credentials with theAmerican Society of Plastic Surgeons.Never go in for surgery without a separate patient consultation.Never go in for surgery without signing an informed consent agreement detailing the procedure.Once you’re sure you’ve found a legitimate plastic surgeon with board certification from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons who performs at an accredited facility, there are several things you should look for in your patient consultation, say experts. During the initial meeting, your surgeon should ask for your full medical history, including:Family historyHistory of illness and hospitalizations Activity levelMental health historyLifestyle habits like smoking, drinking and drug useList of current medicationsPast history of drug interactions or reactions to anesthesiaPast history of surgery and medical emergenciesRespiratory ailments or problemsPossible caregivers and home environment detailsA full physical examination should take place before your scheduled procedure. Legitimate surgeons turn away about 3 out of 10 candidates due to potential complications.This may scare some patients away from wanting to be fully candid with their surgeons.

"What cosmetic issues does IPL treat?IPL’s primary use is to selectively treat discoloration such as:VeinsRosaceaAge SpotsBrown SpotsHair RemovalPort Wine StainsUneven PigmentSun Over-ExposureAdded benefits of IPL include skin smoothing, diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles, reduction of pore size, less redness, and improved skin tone.Why IPL Photorejuvenation?Practitioners say the benefits of IPL is that IPL systems are very versatile and can target specific areas within the dermis, while leaving the epidermis alone. It also stimulates collagen production to rejuvenate the texture of the skin, leaving tighter and younger-looking skin in its wake. Alternatives to IPL include laser resurfacing and chemical peels, which require patients to “hunker down” for extended periods of time as their redness and swelling subside. Microdermabrasion is helpful for some surface-level skin irregularities, but cannot resolve redness, broken capillaries, or port wine stains. Facelifts require even more downtime and are not ideal for every patient. How long do IPL treatments take?With three to five 10 to 20-minute sessions, surgeons can cover a large area with dramatic results. The effects will last for several years or longer if you take care to avoid too much sun exposure.What does IPL feel like?Some people say the treatment feels like “a warm lamp next to the skin,” while others say they occasionally feel “a rubber band snap” sensation. Immediate side effects include minor swelling, redness, and increased visibility of small capillaries, but these symptoms generally resolve within a few days.
